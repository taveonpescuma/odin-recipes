<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
    <li> Fettuccine Noodle </li>
    <li> Cream (not milk or half and half) </li>
    <li>Chicken Breast, or grilled chicken</li>
    <li>Parmesan-Reggiano</li>
    <li>Nutmeg</li>
</ul>
<h4>Steps:</h4>
<ol>
    <li>1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil, and salt generously. 
    Add the pasta and cook according to package directions until al dente 
    (tender but still slightly firm). Drain and toss with a splash of oil.</li>
    <li>2. Meanwhile, slice the chicken into 1/4-inch-thick strips, and lay them 
    on a plate or a sheet of waxed paper. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
    <li> 3. Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add 2 tablespoons of 
        the butter. When the butter melts, raise the heat to medium-high 
        and add the chicken in 1 layer. Cook, without moving the pieces, 
        until the underside has browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip the pieces,
         and cook until browned and cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes more. 
         Transfer the chicken to a medium bowl. </li>
    <li> 4. Reduce the heat to medium. Add the remaining 6 tablespoons butter.
             Scrape the bottom of the skillet with a wooden spoon to release any 
             browned bits. When the butter has mostly melted, whisk in the cream
              and nutmeg and bring to a simmer, then cook for 2 minutes. Lower the 
              heat to keep the sauce just warm.</li>
    <li>5. Whisk the Parmigiano-Reggiano into the sauce. Add the chicken 
        and cooked pasta and toss well. Season with salt and pepper. 
        Serve hot in heated bowls.</li>
